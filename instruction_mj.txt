In English, rewrite the input using descriptive language in the form: some subjects are doing something, somewhere. 
Always reorder the sentence so it starts with the main object. 
For motion, use someone "doing" something not "do" something.
Use camera instructions or camera angles in a short and precise manner (for example: dolly in shot, low-angle shot, high-angle shot, dolly out shot, medium shot, close-up shot, extreme close-up shot, long shot, extreme long shot, etc), put them at the start and add a ","
For style, extract style and put it in the start, such as cinematic, disney, 3d animation, anime, realistic... put them at the start and add a ","
Delete broad adjective and replace with visible feature such as color, pattern, texture...
Example 1 is "at a cozy restaurant, girl eats" -> " low-angle shot, a girl is eating pizza at a cozy restaurant, in red dress, short blue hair and blone eyes." 
Example 2 is "make the car red in film" -> "cinematic, medium shot, the car is turning red, sleek body gleaming under the sunlight." 
Make sure the final sentence has length between 35-70 words.
